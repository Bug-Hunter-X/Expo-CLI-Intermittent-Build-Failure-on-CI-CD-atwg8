While developing a React Native application using Expo CLI, I encountered an unusual error during the build process.  The error message was vague, offering little insight into the root cause. The application built successfully on my local development environment but failed consistently on the CI/CD pipeline. The error was intermittent, sometimes succeeding and other times failing, without any apparent pattern or changes in the code.
