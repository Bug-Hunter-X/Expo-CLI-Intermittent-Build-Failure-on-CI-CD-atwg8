The intermittent nature of the error suggests an issue with the build environment or potentially conflicting dependencies.  A possible solution is to ensure your CI/CD environment mirrors your local development environment as closely as possible, including Node.js version, npm or yarn version, and any other global dependencies.  Another common cause is inconsistent caching.  Try clearing the Expo cache and rebuilding the project. 

//bugSolution.js

// Ensure consistent Node.js and npm versions in your CI/CD pipeline
// Clear Expo cache: expo prebuild --clean
// Ensure all dependencies are correctly installed in CI/CD
// Investigate build logs for specific warnings or errors that may provide clues to a more definite solution
